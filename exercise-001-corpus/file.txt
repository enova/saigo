The oldest samurai was named Bo. He was the best samurai, because of his experience. He knew this, and so did everyone else.

Bo woke up every day at the same time. He ate the same breakfast, the same lunch, and the same dinner. At night, he went to bed at the same time, every night. During the day, he spent his time mentoring samurai in training.

One day, a young samurai named Gail arrived at Bo's town, which was called FunTown, in the country of Awesome Place. She wore pretty armor The locals of FunTown, Awesome Place were immediately impressed by her.

This was because she was loud and boastful, and in the town of FunTown, being loud and boastful was a rare thing.

"I am the best samurai", she proclaimed to everyone she saw.

"But - " said the townspeople, "Bo is the best samurai. He is oldest, and therefore the best."
