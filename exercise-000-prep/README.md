## Prepare!

You will read chapters 2 - 10 and portions of chapter 13 of Caleb Doxsey's [An Introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro) and discuss the material with an instructor.

Try to cover chapters 2 through 10 in their entirety. In chapter 13 the most relevant sections are _Strings_, _Files & Folders_ and _Sort_.

## Recommended Practice

Here is the recommended practice for learners and instructors:

1. Read through a single chapter
2. Do all the exercises at the end of the chapter - most of them are super short
3. Schedule a 15-minute session with an instructor
  1. Explain the material back to the instructor in your own words
  2. Present your solutions to the instructor

During the session your instructor may choose to ask you additional questions about the material.
